Latex Snippets in ST3 on Crystallography

These LaTeX snippets are especially written for application in Crystallography.

Before you can use these snippets, you should:

1. Install [*A font for crystallographic symmetry elements*](http://www.iucr.org/resources/symmetry-font);
2. Defining your colors according to my snippets (I used "myBlue" and "myOrange"), you can define you favorite;
3. Using **TikZ** Package; (You may also need other packages, I assume that you are a good LaTeX user)

If you are good at LaTeX and also have a passionate for Science and Engineering, you are welcomed to add and share more!
